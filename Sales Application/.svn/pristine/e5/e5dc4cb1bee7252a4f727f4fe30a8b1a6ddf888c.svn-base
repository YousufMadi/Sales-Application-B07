| Android:								    | 
|   This application is optimized to work with Google Pixel 3 XL. On first  |
|   run, the database will be initiated, please use the same credentials as |
|   used in the Windows application, which is listed at the end of this     |
|   file for reference. Please also note that as a design choice, we are    |
|   restricting customers to only one active account, which is created by   |
|   the employee. In addition, since authenticate user was never            |
|   implemented due to Joe's decisions, all it does is direct you to        |
|   creating a new user. Creating a new user includes both creating a new   |
|   employee or a customer. Also, in the customer's view, please scroll     |
|   down to see the rest of the buttons.				    |
